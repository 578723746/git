Wasting way too much time on msysGit

I recently got into the bad habit of spending a large amount of my waking
hours working on msysGit, more than is really healthy for me.

For example, I spent the whole morning -- when I should have worked on a
very important day-job project -- on trying to fix issue 258, where
''git web--browse'' does not work as expected because of quoting issues
with cmd.exe.

This is reducing my Git time budget to negative numbers, so much so that I
cannot even work on Git projects that I actually like, such as ''jgit diff''
or ''git rebase -i -p'', or at least projects I felt obliged to continue
to work on, such as ''git notes''.

Now, some people who tried to teach me some time management strongly
criticized me for ignoring their lessons, and unfortunately, I have to agree.

The problem is that I would _hate_ to see msysGit fall to the same state it
was after I stopped working on it last year.  I started it, and I would like
it to grow, but too few people took care of the issue tracker, too few tried
to debug their problems themselves, too few submitted fixes.

I note, though, that there is a positive trend.  But being the impatient person
I am ("2 seconds is my attention span") I tend to want the trend to be more
impressive.

Anyway, no work on msysGit for at least 4 days, that's what the doctor (me)
said...
