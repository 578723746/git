Interactive ''rebase'' just learnt a new command: ''topic''

Today I am pretty pleased with myself.  Two projects at my day job got a real
boost, and I implemented a shortcut that avoids the ugly 'bookmark' statement
in rebase scripts most of the time.

A typical rebase script, generated by ''git rebase -i -p $COMMIT'' will look
something like this:

<bash>
pick 1234567 My first commit
topic begin super-cool-feature
pick 2345678 The super cool feature
pick 3456789 Documentation for the super cool feature
topic end super-cool-feature
</bash>

The result will be a merge commit at the HEAD whose first parent is
"My first commit", whose second parent is "Documentation for the super
cool feature" and whose commit message is "Merge branch 'super-cool-feature'".

Side note: internally, ''topic begin $NAME [at $COMMIT]'' will be handled as if
you wrote ''bookmark merge-parent-of-$NAME; goto $COMMIT'', and
''topic end $NAME [$MESSAGE]'' will be handled as if you wrote
''bookmark $NAME; goto merge-parent-of-$NAME; merge parents $NAME [original $MARK Merge branch '$NAME']''.

Of course, being more concise, the 'topic' statement is not only nicer to the
eye, but also less error-prone.

And hopefully many people will agree with me that this rebase script is pretty
intuitive.
