My new blog system... bloGit

Nowadays, you got to have your blog.  Or better: your blogs.  Even Junio
blogs about Git.

So I felt a little left behind, having no blog to show off.  But then
I read about this fantastic new website on the mailing list, called
''git planet'' which was supposed to be a place where you could have your
Git located blog.

Except that you could not have your blog _there_.  Instead, it is just an
aggregator site.

I was disappointed.

But then, I had this (IMHO very cute) idea that I already used to "publish"
my slides from the talk "Contributing with Git (AKA All your rebase are
belong to us)": back then, I just created a new branch, committed the
file, and uploaded the result to repo.or.cz, to be downloaded via Gitweb.

So I asked Pasky via IRC, if he would have any objections if I abused
repo.or.cz as a blog server.  He understood at once, and found it "sounds
like a pretty cool idea".

Of course, just writing plain HTML and committing that is ''too easy'',
therefore I decided to write a shell script that would turn some sort
of simple text file into proper HTML, commit it, and upload the result.

Well, about two hours later, I finished the first version of the script
turning plain text with minimal markup into an HTML page, and it obviously
worked -- otherwise nobody would be able to read this :-)
