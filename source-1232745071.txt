Git Logos

The other day, when I did not exactly have too much time on my hands, but
definitely too much motivation, I played around creating several logos.

An ambigram (if you turn it 180 degrees around the appropriate axis, it looks
exactly the same as unrotated):

A play on gitk:

A play on the test you have to go through before getting new glasses:

[[SVG:git-visual-test.svg]]

This is Henrik Nyh's logo (converted to .svg by yours truly):

[[SVG:gitlogo.svg]]

And of course, the original logo...

Maybe some of you have fun with them...
