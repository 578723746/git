How to deal with files that are not source code when merging

Last week, one of the mentors of last year's <a href=http://code.google.com/soc>
Summer of Code</a> mentioned the idea that merge strategies are in dear need
for file types other than source code.

I think this idea is awesome, even if I cannot bring myself to believe that
any of the file types would make a good Summer of Code project: either they
are too complicated (think raster images such as .png or even .jpg), or they
are too straight-forward (think LaTeX, where all that is needed is a good
graphical user interface to inspect the three versions: ''ours'', ''baseline''
and ''theirs'').

The LaTeX idea would be a good project for me to mentor, though: I have a
pretty clear idea how it should be done; I just lack the time (and motivation)
to do it myself.

As for OpenOffice text documents, vector graphics (such as .svg), or more
specific data such as spreadsheets, I think that all of these are really
difficult: the problem is not so much the implementation (i.e. the programming
part of it), but the design.

This design should involve much more than a Summer of Code project is about:
you would need to survey users' expectations, and at least the mentor -- if
not the student -- would need to be an expert in usability questions, which
is rather unlikely in the realm of Open Source.

Maybe this is the missing part in Open Source: we have many brilliant
programmers, but next to nobody with a good idea how to design intuitive
user interfaces.

That might be related to the fact that brilliant software engineers, as they
can be found in Open Source, are not exactly known for their social skills,
a human trait that seems to be a very important prerequisite for designing
intuitive user interfaces.

Well, I have <a href=http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/SoC2009Ideas#head-6188833471f79f277e162ef9fbe1592aa10b5f6c>
added the proposal to Git's Summer of Code idea page on the Git Wiki; We will
see what comes out of it.
