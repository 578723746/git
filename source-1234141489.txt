''format-patch --thread'' and Alpine

I started recently to pipe the output of
''git format-patch --cover-letter --stdout ...'' directly into the
''postponed-msgs'' folder Alpine uses, instead of pasting files into the
mailer.

The idea is to pretend that I continue a postponed mail, but in reality I
never wrote it, ''format-patch'' did.

However, I had problems with the ''--thread'' option that is implied by
''--cover-letter''.  Alpine always generated new message IDs without adjusting
the ''In-reply-to:'' and ''References:'' headers of the other mails.

Now I found out that the reason is that the ''Fcc:'' headers were missing in
the mails, and Alpine generated them, making up new message IDs in the process.

Therefore I have an alias now which sets not only the ''Fcc:'' header, but also
the ''To:'' headers by rewriting the stream using ''sed''.  This is slightly
ugly, but so is the handling of headers in ''format-patch'': if you thought
you could specify arbitrary headers using the command line, you are mistaken:
you can do that only by editing the config.

While at it, I also noticed a bug whereby ''--thread --in-reply-to=...'' simply
forgets the ''--thread''.  Maybe this week I will find time to address this bug.
