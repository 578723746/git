Git will never be user-friendly

Recently, encouraged by quite some private encouragement, I thought I could
take on the task of teaching the core Git developers how user-unfriendly
Git is, and that they should be more open to change (especially given that
1.7.0 was already announced to be a version that breaks recent expectations,
something I would have expected to merit a 2.0 -- but who am I anyway?).

It is quite ironic, in a very cruel sense, that those people who are such
big fans of educating the users instead of fixing their tools are unable
to be educated about something that should be obvious.

Yes, I am bitter.
