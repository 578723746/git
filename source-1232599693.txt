My blog has style

It is official.  The blog has a style sheet now.

The major problem was how to design the system such that it would work
both locally and on repo.or.cz via gitweb.

Basically, I realized that I'd need a dry run mode anyway, to prevent
all my failed attemp.. oops, I meant, to prevent an accidental push
when I am at an, ahem, intermediate state of the 'blog' branch.

Therefore, I could write a different file locally, which I can load
into my venerable Firefox.

The next plans with my new toy are to enable an easy way to support
showing images, and then maybe a table of contents.  External links
would be cool (repo.or.cz does not count, it is special-cased), too.

And later maybe a cut-off, with automatic generation of links to older
posts.  Hmm, for those, I'll have to change the URL to include the
current commit name, so that the images will be found, too...

Which in turn means that I'll have to parse the source for new
images first, so that they can be in the commit that index.html
will link to, _before_ it gets committed.  Oh well, that cannot be
helped! :-)
