Top-posting

Okay, last post for a while.  But this is something that is nagging me
tremendously.  I should probably just let go, but in my deepest inner self,
really close to my heart, I refuse to believe that any human beings could
be incapable of certain degrees of reason.

Take the example of top-posting.  Everybody who read a top-posted email
knows that you have to scroll down, possibly weeding through tons of
pages to find out what the heck the author of the last reply was replying
to.

Never mind that it would take the author of the reply just a couple of
seconds to remove all the irrelevant stuff -- as she already knows what
is the relevant part, saving minutes, in case of mailing lists hours,
easily, to the readers who otherwise would have to discern what is
irrelevant and what is relevant first.

It is a horrible time waste.  But of course not for the top-poster.

The problem is that I frequently run into such people, and when I write
them a polite mail, explaining to them that it is impolite to top-post,
and why, the answers I get sometimes make me check if the sky is still up
and the earth down.  Yesterday was an example of such a dubitable
pleasure.

Most funny are the ridiculous attempts by those persons at explaining why
top-posting is ''so'' much superior to anything else.

Which is good, because if they were not that funny, they would be pretty sad.
