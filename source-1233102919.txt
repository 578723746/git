Showing off that you're an Alpine user ... priceless!

So I was in a hurry to send the patches, and sent all the patches as replies
to the cover-letter, and therefore typed in ''rnyn'' all the time, which is the
mantra I need to say to Alpine for ''Reply'', ... include quoted message?
''No'', ... reply to all recipients? ''Yes'', ... use first role?
''No, use default role''.

That was pretty embarassing, as it shows everybody that I still do not trust
''send-email'', and rather paste every single patch by hand.  Which is rather
annoying.

So I started using format-patch today, to output directly to Alpine's
''postponed-msgs'' folder, so that I can do some touchups in the mailer
before sending the patch series on its way.

However, when running format-patch with ''--thread'', it generates Message-ID
strings that Alpine does not like, and therefore replaces.

Oh, well, I'll probably just investigate how the Message-IDs are supposed to
look, and then use sed to rewrite the generated ones by Alpine-friendly ones
during the redirection to ''postponed-msgs''.

But I alread realized that doing it that way is dramatically faster than the
workflow I had before.

And safer: no more ''rnyn''.
