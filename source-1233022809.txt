Fun with calculus after midnight

Problem: what is the shortest way of defining a variable consisting of ''N''
spaces?  I.e. for ''N=80'' the result will look something like

<bash>
s='    '
s="$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s"
</bash>

Let's see.  Let the minimal number of characters needed be ''A(N)''.  For
simplicity, let's say that we only use one variable.  Then, certainly, ''A(N)''
cannot be larger than ''5+N'', as we could define a variable using 1 character
for the name, 1 for the equal sign, 2 for the quotes, and one for the semicolon
or newline character (whichever).

Now, let's assume ''N'' is a product ''K*L''.  Then certainly, ''A(N)'' cannot
be larger than ''A(K)+5+2*L'', as we could first define a variable that has
exactly ''K'' spaces and then use that to define the end result (in the example
above, ''K=5'' and ''L=20'').

So, for which ''N=K*L'' is it better to use two definitions instead of one?

Simple calculus says that ''5+K*L>5+K+5+2*L'' must hold true, or (after some
scribbling): ''L>1+7/(K-2)''. Which means that it makes no sense to define
a variable with 1 or 2 spaces first, which is kinda obvious (writing '$s'
alone would use two characters, so we could write the spaces right away).

But what for the other values?  For ''K=3'', ''L'' must be at least 9 to make
sense (in other words, ''N'' must be at least 27).  For ''K=4'', ''L'' needs
to be greater or equal to 5 (''N>=20''), the next pairs are ''(5,4)'',
''(6,3)'', ''(7,3)'', ''(8,3)'', ''(9,3)'' and starting with ''K=10'', any
''L>1'' makes sense.

The second definition can also contain spaces at the end, however, so for any
''N=K*L+M'', ''A(N)'' cannot be larger than ''A(K)+5+2*L+M''.

Not surprisingly, this leads to exactly the same ''L>1+7/(K-2)'' (as we can
append the ''M'' spaces in the last definition, no matter if we use 1 or
2 definitions).

However, that means that as soon as ''N>=18'', we should use two definitions,
prior to that, it makes no sense.

So for ''N<18'', ''A(N)=5+N''.

But what ''K'' should one choose, i.e. how many spaces in the first definition?
In other words, what is ''A(N)'' given that we use two definitions?

That will have to wait for another midnight.  Just a teaser: ''A(80)=36''.  Oh,
and with 80 characters, you can define a string of 9900 spaces...
