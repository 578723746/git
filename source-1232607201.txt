Sverre's hat

The fun part about a blog is that you can talk about less technical stuff.
For example, Sverre's hat.

Let me start a bit earlier, so that you get the context.

Last year, at the <a href=http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitTogether>GitTogether</a>,
we had an <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference>unconference style
conference</a>, which basically meant that it was our job to decide what
we want to talk about.

It turned out to be pretty hard, because there was so much we wanted to
discuss, and because we wanted to get to know each other, and we wanted to
do some hacking.

So to help us decide what subjects, and in which order we wanted to have
scheduled, Shawn opened a series on <a href=http://moderator.appspot.com/>
Google Moderator</a>, a nifty, yet simple application which allows a group
to agree quickly on an agenda.

It worked quite well; However, that little saboteur displayed his sense of
humor so overtly that some entertaining Gitter put the question "Should Sverre
wear a hat?" on the agenda.

Sure enough, the subject got voted up, and eventually, we got Sverre a hat:

BTW another thing I like about this blog engine is that there are no
comments...  Nothing is more annoying than leaving a comment on a blog,
forgetting about it for a few months, and then finding somebody answered
ages ago.

Update: Sverre says it was dsymonds idea.
