Valgrind takes a loooong time

Yesterday, I started a run on a fast machine, and it took roughly 5.5
hours by the machine's clock.

And of course, I redirected stdout only... *sigh*

Which triggered a Google search how to force redirection of all the output
in the test scripts to a file and the terminal at the same time.

It seems as if that is not easily done.  I tried
<center><bash>
exec >(tee out) 2>&1                           </bash></center>

but that did not work: it mumbled something about invalid file handles or some
such.

The only solution I found was:
<center><bash>
mkpipe pipe                                    
tee out < pipe &
exec > pipe 2>&1 </bash></center>

That is a problem for parallel execution, though, so I am still looking for a
better way to do it.

Once I have the output, it is relatively easy to analyze it, as I already
made a script which disects the output into valgrind output and the test
case it came from, then groups by common valgrind output and shows the
result to the user.
