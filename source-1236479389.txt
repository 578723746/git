New Git for Windows version

Phew.  That was quite a day, almost exclusively spent on finishing that
installer.  The worst part: updating GCC seemed not to be such a good idea
after all...

For Windows, we need to use the printf format ''%I64u'' (which is
non-standard, in the common way of Microsoft) if you want to print 64-bit
wide unsigned numbers.  The rest of the world accepts the standard ''%llu''.

After upgrading to the new GCC, a lot of warnings appeared, complaining
about ''%I64u''.  The warnings went away when I replaced the format with
''%llu''.

Being the naive I am, I mistook that for a sign that we could finally go
more standards-compliant.

However, it only means that we have to live with the warnings for now, as
the C runtime provided on Windows still strongly disagrees with standards
(and it has to continue to do so, lest it break existing programs).

Sigh.

At least I have the feeling that I caught the most important bugs before
releasing.
