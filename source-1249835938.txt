The dilemma of being correct

So I am opinionated.  No news there.  The problem of being opinionated, though,
is that people do not take you seriously even if you are correct.

For example, I vividly remember having had concerns about the Git wrapper
being linked to <a href=http://curl.haxx.se/>cURL</a>, and I vividly remember
that our maintainer did not have such concerns and took Daniel's patch.  I could
not find proof of my public comment quickly enough to add a link here, though.

Alas, there are serious problems with being correct:

<ol>
<li>If you're correct, you waste a lot of time trying to convince people (but
they ignore you nevertheless),
<li>Other people are regularly p*ssed off, especially when they find out
(or even worse, when it is pointed out to them) that they were wrong, and
<li>You can buy _nothing_ for having been correct.
</ol>

It is a lose-lose situation.

In the current context, I am pretty certain that the rev cache and the pack
index are so similar in nature that we'll find quite a few issues that we had
with one repeated with the other.

As I _hate_ losing time over a discussion others try to "win" -- which
invariably means that they refuse to be convinced of anything disagreeing with
their opinion :-) -- I will just shut up, and probably have one or two odd
feelings when it turns out I was right.
