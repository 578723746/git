Regular diff with word coloring (as opposed to word diff)

You know, if I were a bit faster with everything I do, I could do so much more!

For example, Junio's idea that you could keep showing a regular diff, only
coloring the words that have been removed/deleted.

Just imagine looking at the diff of a long line in LaTeX source code.  It
should be much nicer to the eye to see the complete removed/added sentences
instead of one sentence with colored words in between, disrupting your read
flow.

Compare these two versions:

Regular diff with colored words:
<blockquote><tt>
-This sentence has a <font color=red>tyop</font> in it.<br>
+This sentence has a <font color=green>typo</font> in it.<br>
</tt></blockquote>

Word diff:
<blockquote><tt>
This sentence has a <font color=red>tyop</font><font color=green>typo</font> in it.<br>
</tt></blockquote>

And it should not be hard to do at all!

In ''diff&#95;words&#95;show()'', we basically get the minus lines as
''diff&#95;words->minus'' and the plus lines as ''diff&#95;words->plus''.  The
function then prepares the word lists and calls the xdiff engine to do all the
hard work, analyzing the result from xdiff and printing the lines in
''fn&#95;out&#95;diff&#95;words&#95;aux()''.

So all that would have to be changed would be to _record_ the positions
of the removed/added words instead of outputting them, and at the end printing
the minus/plus buffers using the recorded information to color the words.

This would involve

<ul>
<li>adding two new members holding the offsets in the ''diff&#95;words''
struct,
<li>having a special handling for that mode in
''fn&#95;out&#95;diff&#95;words&#95;aux()'' that appends the offsets and
returns,
<li>adding a function ''show&#95;lines&#95;with&#95;colored&#95;words()'' that
outputs a buffer with a given prefix ('-' or '+') and coloring the words at
given offsets with a given color,
<li>modify ''diff&#95;words&#95;show()'' to call that function for the "special
case: only removal" and at the end of the function, and
<li> disabling the ''fwrite()'' at the end of ''diff_words_show()'' for that
mode.
</ul>

Of course, the hardest part is to find a nice user interface for that.  Maybe
''--colored-words''? :-)
