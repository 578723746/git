Thunderbird, oh Thunderbird, you always make my small brain hurt

There was a lengthy discussion on the Git mailing list about using Thunderbird,
a not quite unpopular mailing program, to send inline patches.

It is really kind of sad that the Thunderbird developers do not see how
stubbornly they offend quite a number of people and scare them away from their
program.  After all, you should try to be liberal in what you accept and strict
in what you emit.  No, that does not mean that you should force others to
switch their mailers because you strictly adher to your philosophy in what you
emit, ignoring the rest of the world.

In any case, I am not affected (as long as I do not get mails from a poor soul
stuck with Thunderbird).

But I was a bit mean to that Thunderbird guy I dragged into the discussion, and
he seems really offended.

So I thought I'd give him a real reason to feel offended: I'll just do his work:

It took my free time of two days, being not a Thunderbird developer myself.
Hopefully it works, and hopefully some people will feel really ashamed now.
