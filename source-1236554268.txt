So, what is missing from my ''rebase-i-p'' branch?

I regularly use ''rebase -i -p'' these days, to update my personal Git
tree (which used to be ''my-next'').

There are a few things missing before I can start assembling a patch
series for submission:

<ul>
<li>I need to handle the commit parents which are outside of the rebased
ones properly.  In other words, when a commit is picked whose parent is
not rebased, it needs to be rebased onto $ONTO.
<li>The patch which uses patch-id to generate DROPPED directly also tries to
consolidate the handling of DROPPED commits by putting them into REWRITTEN
instead of DROPPED, but that breaks the tests.  So, this patch needs to be
split.
<li>I want to introduce one more command, ''rephrase'', which allows you to
modify the commit message, and nothing more, and ''halt'', which does the
same as ''edit'' without ''pick''.  Then there needs to be a new test script
for those commands, and this will be an early patch series.
<li>Time.  I need time, desperately.  If my day job was not as exciting as it
is, I would have more time for Git.  As it is, I have to budget my time so
that I get anything done at all.
</ul>

These issues have been postponed due to Steffen taking a well-deserved
vacation, which means that I have to act as msysGit maintainer again.

And this coming week, I will have other things to do in all likeliness, so
that I expect to be able to submit a ''rebase -i -p'' patch series only next
week.  If not then, due to a heavy workload, it will be postponed to early
April.

Oh well, the joys of being excited by several competing projects! :-)
