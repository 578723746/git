Problems with split-topic-branches.sh

So my little script that should help me to split my topic branches does
not work properly.

First some background: the idea was to let ''git blame'' do the hard work
to find overlapping changes, i.e. changes that would conflict when
changing the order (or skipping the first change, on which the next builds).

The first problem with that approach: when lines are _removed_ by one
commit, and the next commit touches the same location, ''git blame'' does
not find that the first commit is required by the second.

Therefore I introduced a really slow reverse thing which tries to find
those commits whose removals survived until the parent of a particular
commit, but not further.

However, it does not work properly.  Basically, only context sizes that
span the whole files lead to conflict-free topic branches so far.

As a consequence, I think I'll add an option --sprout to the revision
walker which will fake octopus merges (or a series of two-parent merges)
whenever it finds a perl of non-merge commits that are theoretically
independent, i.e. whose patches apply cleanly.
