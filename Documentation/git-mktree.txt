git-mktree(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-mktree - Build a tree-object from ls-tree formatted text


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git mktree' [-z] [--strict] [--missing] [--batch]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reads standard input in non-recursive `ls-tree` output format, and creates
a tree object.  The order of the tree entries is normalised by mktree so
pre-sorting the input is not required.  The object name of the tree object
built is written to the standard output.

OPTIONS
-------
-z::
	Read the NUL-terminated `ls-tree -z` output instead.

--strict::
	Validate the tree object before writing (the validation is equivalent
	to the one performed by linkgit:git-fsck[1]).

--missing::
	Allow missing objects.  The default behaviour (without this option)
	is to verify that each tree entry's sha1 identifies an existing
	object.  This option has no effect on the treatment of gitlink entries
	(aka "submodules") which are always allowed to be missing.

--batch::
	Allow building of more than one tree object before exiting.  Each
	tree is separated by as single blank line. The final new-line is
	optional.  Note - if the '-z' option is used, lines are terminated
	with NUL.
