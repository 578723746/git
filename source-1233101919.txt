Progress with the interactive rebase preserving merges

I thought about the "dropped" commits a bit more, after all, and it is
probably a good thing to substitute them by their parent, as Stephen did it.

Imagine that you have merged a branch with two commits.  One is in upstream,
and you want to rebase (preserving merges) onto upstream.  Then you still
want to merge the single commit.

Even better, if there is no commit left, the ''$REWRITTEN'' mechanism will
substitute the commit onto which we are rebasing, so a merge will just
result in a fast-forward!

Oh, another thing: merge commits should not have a patch id, as they have
_multiple_ patches.  However, I borked the code long time ago (9c6efa36)
and merges get the patch-id of their diff to the first parent.  Which is
probably wrong.  So I guess I'll have to fix that with my rebase revamp.

So what about a root commit?  If that was dropped, we will just substitute
it with the commit onto which we rebase (as a root commit did not really
have a parent, but will get the onto-commit as new parent)..

Now that I finally realized that t3410 is so strange because of a bug _I_
introduced, I can finally go about fixing it.
