Trying to get more time for msysGit

Nowadays, the msysGit project is driven forward mostly by Heiko Voigt,
Erik Faye-Lund, and of course the invaluable mingw.git work of Hannes
Sixt. The new-SVN, MinGW-SVN and MinGW-Python projects have stalled.
The latest msysGit release is _months_ old.

It does not help that certain people on the Git mailing list write
looooong emails that nobody with my schedule can hope to read, rather
than being nice and spending some time to phrase what they have to
say in a _concise_ manner.

Oh well. I will just concentrate on JGit and msysGit instead of
upstream Git, if I get some Git time.
