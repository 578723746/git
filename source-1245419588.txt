The GraphGUI project

After a few unfortunate delays (and some fortunate ones, just not for us), the
GraphGUI project finally takes off.  A quick first glance:

The delays were a bit unnerving, but the student is really bright and still
has the chance to pull the project off.

Next plans are to show text, too, to invent a rudimentary layout engine that
can be adjusted manually (this is in contrast to ''gitk'' or ''log --graph'').

After that, integration into JGit (this probably triggered the eGit/JGit
split).

And then we'll go wild!
