Code reviews

It has been said that reviewing patches is a most thankless job.  As I really
like the elegance of Git's source code, and care a lot about it, I did not
think that it was thankless, just a little bit tedious (especially when the
patch authors mistake criticism for personal attacks).

Usually, I am pretty good at ignoring insults as responses to my comments;
after all, I have a lot more enjoyable things to do than to spend time talking
to a guy who shows how wise he is when he thinks that I criticize him
_personally_ when I just try to enhance his work, by offering a little bit of
my knowledge.

However, in the last days, three people really seemed to want to insult me,
to make me go away, to stop the fun I have with Git.

And they almost succeeded.

So I guess it is time to reassess my priorities, and maybe stop reviewing
Git patches altogether.
