			<h1>Dscho's blog</h1>
			<h6>Thursday, 22nd of January, Anno Domini MMIX, at the hour of the Tiger</h6>
			<h2>My new blog system... bloGit</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Nowadays, you got to have your blog.  Or better: your blogs.  Even Junio
			blogs about Git.
			</p><p>
			So I felt a little left behind, having no blog to show off.  But then
			I read about this fantastic new website on the mailing list, called
			<i>git planet</i> which was supposed to be a place where you could have your
			Git located blog.
			</p><p>
			Except that you could not have your blog <u>there</u>.  Instead, it is just an
			aggregator site.
			</p><p>
			I was disappointed.
			</p><p>
			But then, I had this (in my humble opinion very cute) idea that I already used to "publish"
			my slides from the talk "Contributing with Git (AKA All your rebase are
			belong to us)": back then, I just created a new branch, committed the
			file, and uploaded the result to <a href=http://repo.or.cz>repo.or.cz</a>, to be downloaded via Gitweb.
			</p><p>
			So I asked Pasky via IRC, if he would have any objections if I abused
			<a href=http://repo.or.cz>repo.or.cz</a> as a blog server.  He understood at once, and found it "sounds
			like a pretty cool idea".
			</p><p>
			Of course, just writing plain HTML and committing that is <i>too easy</i>,
			therefore I decided to write a shell script that would turn some sort
			of simple text file into proper HTML, commit it, and upload the result.
			</p><p>
			Well, about two hours later, I finished the first version of the script
			turning plain text with minimal markup into an HTML page, and it obviously
			worked -- otherwise nobody would be able to read this &#x263a;
