			<h2>Sverre's hat</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			The fun part about a blog is that you can talk about less technical stuff.
			For example, Sverre's hat.
			</p><p>
			Let me start a bit earlier, so that you get the context.
			</p><p>
			Last year, at the <a href=http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitTogether>GitTogether</a>,
			we had an <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference>unconference style
			conference</a>, which basically meant that it was our job to decide what
			we want to talk about.
			</p><p>
			It turned out to be pretty hard, because there was so much we wanted to
			discuss, and because we wanted to get to know each other, and we wanted to
			do some hacking.
			</p><p>
			So to help us decide what subjects, and in which order we wanted to have
			scheduled, Shawn opened a series on <a href=http://moderator.appspot.com/>
			Google Moderator</a>, a nifty, yet simple application which allows a group
			to agree quickly on an agenda.
			</p><p>
			It worked quite well; However, that little saboteur displayed his sense of
			humor so overtly that some entertaining Gitter put the question "Should Sverre
			wear a hat?" on the agenda.
			</p><p>
			Sure enough, the subject got voted up, and eventually, we got Sverre a hat:

			</p><p>
			By the way, another thing I like about this blog engine is that there are no
			comments...  Nothing is more annoying than leaving a comment on a blog,
			forgetting about it for a few months, and then finding somebody answered
			ages ago.

			<h2>Let there be images!</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			One of the most important features of blogs is the ability to insert images.
			So what would this blog be, if it could not present something that says
			more than a thousand words?
			</p><p>
			So here it goes, my first picture in this blog, taken from my Google Tech
			Talk in Mountain View:

			</p><p>
			Now this blog starts to look like a real blog...

			<h2>My blog has style</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			It is official.  The blog has a style sheet now.
			</p><p>
			The major problem was how to design the system such that it would work
			both locally and on <a href=http://repo.or.cz>repo.or.cz</a> via gitweb.
			</p><p>
			Basically, I realized that I'd need a dry run mode anyway, to prevent
			all my failed attemp.. oops, I meant, to prevent an accidental push
			when I am at an, ahem, intermediate state of the 'blog' branch.
			</p><p>
			Therefore, I could write a different file locally, which I can load
			into my venerable Firefox.
			</p><p>
			The next plans with my new toy are to enable an easy way to support
			showing images, and then maybe a table of contents.  External links
			would be cool (<a href=http://repo.or.cz>repo.or.cz</a> does not count, it is special-cased), too.
			</p><p>
			And later maybe a cut-off, with automatic generation of links to older
			posts.  Hmm, for those, I'll have to change the URL to include the
			current commit name, so that the images will be found, too...
			</p><p>
			Which in turn means that I'll have to parse the source for new
			images first, so that they can be in the commit that index.html
			will link to, <u>before</u> it gets committed.  Oh well, that cannot be
			helped! &#x263a;

			<h2>My new blog system... bloGit</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Nowadays, you got to have your blog.  Or better: your blogs.  Even Junio
			blogs about Git.
			</p><p>
			So I felt a little left behind, having no blog to show off.  But then
			I read about this fantastic new website on the mailing list, called
			<i>git planet</i> which was supposed to be a place where you could have your
			Git located blog.
			</p><p>
			Except that you could not have your blog <u>there</u>.  Instead, it is just an
			aggregator site.
			</p><p>
			I was disappointed.
			</p><p>
			But then, I had this (in my humble opinion very cute) idea that I already used to "publish"
			my slides from the talk "Contributing with Git (AKA All your rebase are
			belong to us)": back then, I just created a new branch, committed the
			file, and uploaded the result to <a href=http://repo.or.cz>repo.or.cz</a>, to be downloaded via Gitweb.
			</p><p>
			So I asked Pasky via IRC, if he would have any objections if I abused
			<a href=http://repo.or.cz>repo.or.cz</a> as a blog server.  He understood at once, and found it "sounds
			like a pretty cool idea".
			</p><p>
			Of course, just writing plain HTML and committing that is <i>too easy</i>,
			therefore I decided to write a shell script that would turn some sort
			of simple text file into proper HTML, commit it, and upload the result.
			</p><p>
			Well, about two hours later, I finished the first version of the script
			turning plain text with minimal markup into an HTML page, and it obviously
			worked -- otherwise nobody would be able to read this &#x263a;
