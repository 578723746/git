			<h2>GitTogether in Berlin</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			We had a GitTogether in Berlin, called "Alles wird Git" (past tense: "Alles
			wurde Git").  It was great fun, we never had even a single boring minute,
			and our special guest -- Gitzilla -- turned out to be quite some entertainer,
			especially when he starting reciting a few of my most outrageous emails &#x263a;
			</p><p>
			There were a lot of good discussions, among other things about submodules (our
			neglected child), Git Cheetah, and foreign VCS helpers (in particular Sverre's
			plan to provide some Mercurial backend).
			</p><p>
			One of the most important outcomes for me was, though, to realize just how
			detached we in the Git project are from our user base.  A few years back, we
			could get away with saying "we have only developers as users, so they should
			just sit down and scratch their own itch".
			</p><p>
			But today, we have a lot of users who never learnt to code (or who code in
			some other language than C, or whose code we would not even want to review &#x263a;),
			and we lose quite a few brownie points by keeping things complicated.
			</p><p>
			Now, in a lot of cases it cannot be helped.  For example, we have confusing
			names for things, inconsistent namings even (as with "remote" vs "tracked"
			branches), and we have some odd design decisions (like calling some program
			almost nobody uses "git cherry", which makes tab-completion of the rather
			often-used "git cherry-pick" pretty awkward).  The latter example also
			illustrates that we have names for porcelains that are rather long, when
			they should be rather short.
			</p><p>
			So, yes, we have a lot of things that do not work well, because we have
			usability issues that need to be preserved for hysterical raisins.
			</p><p>
			This is unfortunate enough, but it seems that we even fsck up with usability
			issues we <u>can</u> solve.  Just think about "git checkout -b origin/master".  A
			typo?  Yes, of course!  But a rather obvious one.
			</p><p>
			Another case which was discussed on the mailing list recently: "git checkout
			next" when clearly "git checkout origin/next" was meant.
			</p><p>
			The biggest problem, though, is that almost all people on the Git mailing list
			who are respected by the maintainer are obviously too detached from the user
			base to realize just how difficult Git <u>still</u> is.  And refuse to do anything
			about it, or even to allow others to do anything about it.
			</p><p>
			It almost seems as if the Git wizards do not want Git to become easier to
			use, lest they lose their special status.
			</p><p>
			My biggest problem is that it seems that my input gets more and more ignored,
			or perceived as some crazy ideas that will just go away (which is true, because
			I am pretty happy about a day-job that keeps me more than just busy, so I do not
			have time not fight windmills, let alone motiviation to do so).
			</p><p>
			Even when a real user comes along to chime in, he's just brushed off, by an
			otherwise very polite maintainer.
			</p><p>
			I am not even sure if I want to continue sending my patches from my personal
			tree upstream, because things get so frustrating, for little to show in return.
			</p>

			<h2>The dilemma of being correct</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			So I am opinionated.  No news there.  The problem of being opinionated, though,
			is that people do not take you seriously even if you are correct.
			</p><p>
			For example, I vividly remember having had concerns about the Git wrapper
			being linked to <a href=http://curl.haxx.se/>cURL</a>, and I vividly remember
			that our maintainer did not have such concerns and took Daniel's patch.  I could
			not find proof of my public comment quickly enough to add a link here, though.
			</p><p>
			Alas, there are serious problems with being correct:
			</p><p>
			<ol>
			<li>If you're correct, you waste a lot of time trying to convince people (but
			they ignore you nevertheless),
			<li>Other people are regularly p*ssed off, especially when they find out
			(or even worse, when it is pointed out to them) that they were wrong, and
			<li>You can buy <u>nothing</u> for having been correct.
			</ol>
			</p><p>
			It is a lose-lose situation.
			</p><p>
			In the current context, I am pretty certain that the rev cache and the pack
			index are so similar in nature that we'll find quite a few issues that we had
			with one repeated with the other.
			</p><p>
			As I <u>hate</u> losing time over a discussion others try to "win" -- which
			invariably means that they refuse to be convinced of anything disagreeing with
			their opinion &#x263a; -- I will just shut up, and probably have one or two odd
			feelings when it turns out I was right.

			<h2>The GraphGUI project</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			After a few unfortunate delays (and some fortunate ones, just not for us), the
			GraphGUI project finally takes off.  A quick first glance:
			</p><p>
			<center><img src=dscho.git?a=blob_plain;hb=c33212b23b2b3e45c14403efe82cabb1cd53f6e3;f=basic-gui.jpg basic-gui.jpg></center>
			</p><p>
			The delays were a bit unnerving, but the student is really bright and still
			has the chance to pull the project off.
			</p><p>
			Next plans are to show text, too, to invent a rudimentary layout engine that
			can be adjusted manually (this is in contrast to <i>gitk</i> or <i>log --graph</i>).
			</p><p>
			After that, integration into JGit (this probably triggered the eGit/JGit
			split).
			</p><p>
			And then we'll go wild!

			<h2>Wasting way too much time on msysGit</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			I recently got into the bad habit of spending a large amount of my waking
			hours working on msysGit, more than is really healthy for me.
			</p><p>
			For example, I spent the whole morning -- when I should have worked on a
			very important day-job project -- on trying to fix issue 258, where
			<i>git web--browse</i> does not work as expected because of quoting issues
			with cmd.exe.
			</p><p>
			This is reducing my Git time budget to negative numbers, so much so that I
			cannot even work on Git projects that I actually like, such as <i>jgit diff</i>
			or <i>git rebase -i -p</i>, or at least projects I felt obliged to continue
			to work on, such as <i>git notes</i>.
			</p><p>
			Now, some people who tried to teach me some time management strongly
			criticized me for ignoring their lessons, and unfortunately, I have to agree.
			</p><p>
			The problem is that I would <u>hate</u> to see msysGit fall to the same state it
			was after I stopped working on it last year.  I started it, and I would like
			it to grow, but too few people took care of the issue tracker, too few tried
			to debug their problems themselves, too few submitted fixes.
			</p><p>
			I note, though, that there is a positive trend.  But being the impatient person
			I am ("2 seconds is my attention span") I tend to want the trend to be more
			impressive.
			</p><p>
			Anyway, no work on msysGit for at least 4 days, that's what the doctor (me)
			said...

			<h2>Working on jgit diff</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Shawn did so many useful things that I use on a daily basis that I felt really
			awful when I realized just how <u>long</u> I had promised to clean up that diff
			implementation I wrote for JGit.
			</p><p>
			Alas, it appears that the thing turned out to be almost a complete rewrite, as
			the original implementation walked the edit graph in a rather inefficient way.
			</p><p>
			A little background: Myers' algorithm to generate "an edit script" works on
			the <i>edit graph</i>: imagine you have all lines of file <i>A</i> as columns and
			all lines of file <i>B</i> as rows, then the <i>edit graph</i> is a connection of
			the upper left corner to the lower right corner, containing only horizontal,
			vertical or diagonal elements, where diagonal elements are only allowed when
			the lines of both files agree at that point:
			</p><p>
<pre>
 H E L L O , W O R L D
 ----
L    \
      ---
O        \
          ---
W            \
              --------
</pre>
			</p><p>
			The <i>shortest</i> edit path minimizes the number of non-diagonal elements.
			</p><p>
			Myers' idea is to develop forward and backward paths at the same time
			(increasing the number of non-diagonal elements uniformly), storing
			only the latest end points.  Once the paths meet, divide and conquer.
			</p><p>
			In theory, it would be quicker to store <u>all</u> end points and then just
			reconstruct the shortest paths, alas, this takes way too much memory.
			</p><p>
			My first implementation did not remember start or end of the non-diagonal
			parts, and had to recurse way more often than really necessary (in the end,
			we will order the non-diagonal parts into horizontal and vertical parts
			anyway, so start and end are sufficient).
			</p><p>

			<h2>No time for Git</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			It is a shame, but most of my Git time budget is taken by msysGit these
			days.
			</p><p>
			But at least msysGit is moving again; I'll probably write a Herald about
			it.

			<h2>How to recover from a hackathon</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Phew, 2 crazy and fantastic weeks are behind me.  But it takes its toll:
			a weekend I was more offline than online.
			</p><p>
			Things that are important now: relax. sleep. take a walk. learn to sleep
			more than 4 hours a night again. learn to watch a movie without thinking
			about code. go for a run.
			</p><p>
			And after recovering, back to the rebase-i-p branch!
			</p>
			<h6>Monday, 9th of March, Anno Domini MMIX, at the hour of the Rat</h6>
			<a name=1236554268>
			<h2>So, what is missing from my <i>rebase-i-p</i> branch?</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			I regularly use <i>rebase -i -p</i> these days, to update my personal Git
			tree (which used to be <i>my-next</i>).
			</p><p>
			There are a few things missing before I can start assembling a patch
			series for submission:
			</p><p>
			<ul>
			<li>I need to handle the commit parents which are outside of the rebased
			ones properly.  In other words, when a commit is picked whose parent is
			not rebased, it needs to be rebased onto $ONTO.
			<li>The patch which uses patch-id to generate DROPPED directly also tries to
			consolidate the handling of DROPPED commits by putting them into REWRITTEN
			instead of DROPPED, but that breaks the tests.  So, this patch needs to be
			split.
			<li>I want to introduce one more command, <i>rephrase</i>, which allows you to
			modify the commit message, and nothing more, and <i>halt</i>, which does the
			same as <i>edit</i> without <i>pick</i>.  Then there needs to be a new test script
			for those commands, and this will be an early patch series.
			<li>Time.  I need time, desperately.  If my day job was not as exciting as it
			is, I would have more time for Git.  As it is, I have to budget my time so
			that I get anything done at all.
			</ul>
			</p><p>
			These issues have been postponed due to Steffen taking a well-deserved
			vacation, which means that I have to act as msysGit maintainer again.
			</p><p>
			And this coming week, I will have other things to do in all likeliness, so
			that I expect to be able to submit a <i>rebase -i -p</i> patch series only next
			week.  If not then, due to a heavy workload, it will be postponed to early
			April.
			</p><p>
			Oh well, the joys of being excited by several competing projects! &#x263a;

			<h2>New Git for Windows version</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Phew.  That was quite a day, almost exclusively spent on finishing that
			installer.  The worst part: updating GCC seemed not to be such a good idea
			after all...
			</p><p>
			For Windows, we need to use the printf format <i>%I64u</i> (which is
			non-standard, in the common way of Microsoft) if you want to print 64-bit
			wide unsigned numbers.  The rest of the world accepts the standard <i>%llu</i>.
			</p><p>
			After upgrading to the new GCC, a lot of warnings appeared, complaining
			about <i>%I64u</i>.  The warnings went away when I replaced the format with
			<i>%llu</i>.
			</p><p>
			Being the naive I am, I mistook that for a sign that we could finally go
			more standards-compliant.
			</p><p>
			However, it only means that we have to live with the warnings for now, as
			the C runtime provided on Windows still strongly disagrees with standards
			(and it has to continue to do so, lest it break existing programs).
			</p><p>
			Sigh.
			</p><p>
			At least I have the feeling that I caught the most important bugs before
			releasing.
			</p>
			<h6>Friday, 20th of February, Anno Domini MMIX, at the hour of the Buffalo</h6>
			<a name=1235092615>
			<h2>Code reviews</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			It has been said that reviewing patches is a most thankless job.  As I really
			like the elegance of Git's source code, and care a lot about it, I did not
			think that it was thankless, just a little bit tedious (especially when the
			patch authors mistake criticism for personal attacks).
			</p><p>
			Usually, I am pretty good at ignoring insults as responses to my comments;
			after all, I have a lot more enjoyable things to do than to spend time talking
			to a guy who shows how wise he is when he thinks that I criticize him
			<u>personally</u> when I just try to enhance his work, by offering a little bit of
			my knowledge.
			</p><p>
			However, in the last days, three people really seemed to want to insult me,
			to make me go away, to stop the fun I have with Git.
			</p><p>
			And they almost succeeded.
			</p><p>
			So I guess it is time to reassess my priorities, and maybe stop reviewing
			Git patches altogether.
