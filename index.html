			<h2>Showing off that you're an Alpine user ... priceless!</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			So I was in a hurry to send the patches, and sent all the patches as replies
			to the cover-letter, and therefore typed in <i>rnyn</i> all the time, which is the
			mantra I need to say to Alpine for <i>Reply</i>, ... include quoted message?
			<i>No</i>, ... reply to all recipients? <i>Yes</i>, ... use first role?
			<i>No, use default role</i>.
			</p><p>
			That was pretty embarassing, as it shows everybody that I still do not trust
			<i>send-email</i>, and rather paste every single patch by hand.  Which is rather
			annoying.
			</p><p>
			So I started using format-patch today, to output directly to Alpine's
			<i>postponed-msgs</i> folder, so that I can do some touchups in the mailer
			before sending the patch series on its way.
			</p><p>
			However, when running format-patch with <i>--thread</i>, it generates Message-ID
			strings that Alpine does not like, and therefore replaces.
			</p><p>
			Oh, well, I'll probably just investigate how the Message-IDs are supposed to
			look, and then use sed to rewrite the generated ones by Alpine-friendly ones
			during the redirection to <i>postponed-msgs</i>.
			</p><p>
			But I alread realized that doing it that way is dramatically faster than the
			workflow I had before.
			</p><p>
			And safer: no more <i>rnyn</i>.

			<h2>Progress with the interactive rebase preserving merges</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			I thought about the "dropped" commits a bit more, after all, and it is
			probably a good thing to substitute them by their parent, as Stephen did it.
			</p><p>
			Imagine that you have merged a branch with two commits.  One is in upstream,
			and you want to rebase (preserving merges) onto upstream.  Then you still
			want to merge the single commit.
			</p><p>
			Even better, if there is no commit left, the <i>$REWRITTEN</i> mechanism will
			substitute the commit onto which we are rebasing, so a merge will just
			result in a fast-forward!
			</p><p>
			Oh, another thing: merge commits should not have a patch id, as they have
			<u>multiple</u> patches.  However, I borked the code long time ago (9c6efa36)
			and merges get the patch-id of their diff to the first parent.  Which is
			probably wrong.  So I guess I'll have to fix that with my rebase revamp.
			</p><p>
			So what about a root commit?  If that was dropped, we will just substitute
			it with the commit onto which we rebase (as a root commit did not really
			have a parent, but will get the onto-commit as new parent)..
			</p><p>
			Now that I finally realized that t3410 is so strange because of a bug <u>I</u>
			introduced, I can finally go about fixing it.

			<h2>Fun with calculus after midnight</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Problem: what is the shortest way of defining a variable consisting of <i>N</i>
			spaces?  I.e. for <i>N=80</i> the result will look something like
			</p><p>
			<table
							border=1 bgcolor=black>
						<tr><td bgcolor=lightblue colspan=3>
				<pre>                                                                                </pre>
			</td></tr>
			<tr><td>
				<table cellspacing=5 border=0
					 style="color:white;">
				<tr><td>
					<pre>
s='    '
s="$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s"
</pre>
							</td></tr>
							</table>
						</td></tr>
						</table>
			</p><p>
			Let's see.  Let the minimal number of characters needed be <i>A(N)</i>.  For
			simplicity, let's say that we only use one variable.  Then, certainly, <i>A(N)</i>
			cannot be larger than <i>5+N</i>, as we could define a variable using 1 character
			for the name, 1 for the equal sign, 2 for the quotes, and one for the semicolon
			or newline character (whichever).
			</p><p>
			Now, let's assume <i>N</i> is a product <i>K*L</i>.  Then certainly, <i>A(N)</i> cannot
			be larger than <i>A(K)+5+2*L</i>, as we could first define a variable that has
			exactly <i>K</i> spaces and then use that to define the end result (in the example
			above, <i>K=5</i> and <i>L=20</i>).
			</p><p>
			So, for which <i>N=K*L</i> is it better to use two definitions instead of one?
			</p><p>
			Simple calculus says that <i>5+K*L>5+K+5+2*L</i> must hold true, or (after some
			scribbling): <i>L>1+7/(K-2)</i>. Which means that it makes no sense to define
			a variable with 1 or 2 spaces first, which is kinda obvious (writing '$s'
			alone would use two characters, so we could write the spaces right away).
			</p><p>
			But what for the other values?  For <i>K=3</i>, <i>L</i> must be at least 9 to make
			sense (in other words, <i>N</i> must be at least 27).  For <i>K=4</i>, <i>L</i> needs
			to be greater or equal to 5 (<i>N>=20</i>), the next pairs are <i>(5,4)</i>,
			<i>(6,3)</i>, <i>(7,3)</i>, <i>(8,3)</i>, <i>(9,3)</i> and starting with <i>K=10</i>, any
			<i>L>1</i> makes sense.
			</p><p>
			The second definition can also contain spaces at the end, however, so for any
			<i>N=K*L+M</i>, <i>A(N)</i> cannot be larger than <i>A(K)+5+2*L+M</i>.
			</p><p>
			Not surprisingly, this leads to exactly the same <i>L>1+7/(K-2)</i> (as we can
			append the <i>M</i> spaces in the last definition, no matter if we use 1 or
			2 definitions).
			</p><p>
			However, that means that as soon as <i>N>=18</i>, we should use two definitions,
			prior to that, it makes no sense.
			</p><p>
			So for <i>N<18</i>, <i>A(N)=5+N</i>.
			</p><p>
			But what <i>K</i> should one choose, i.e. how many spaces in the first definition?
			In other words, what is <i>A(N)</i> given that we use two definitions?
			</p><p>
			That will have to wait for another midnight.  Just a teaser: <i>A(80)=36</i>.  Oh,
			and with 80 characters, you can define a string of 9900 spaces...

			<h2>Valgrind takes a loooong time</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Yesterday, I started a run on a fast machine, and it took roughly 5.5
			hours by the machine's clock.
			</p><p>
			And of course, I redirected stdout only... *sigh*
			</p><p>
			Which triggered a Google search how to force redirection of all the output
			in the test scripts to a file and the terminal at the same time.
			</p><p>
			It seems as if that is not easily done.  I tried
			<center><table
							border=1 bgcolor=black>
						<tr><td bgcolor=lightblue colspan=3>
				<pre>                                                                                </pre>
			</td></tr>
			<tr><td>
				<table cellspacing=5 border=0
					 style="color:white;">
				<tr><td>
					<pre>
exec >(tee out) 2>&1
</pre>
							</td></tr>
							</table>
						</td></tr>
						</table></center>
			</p><p>
			but that did not work: it mumbled something about invalid file handles or some
			such.
			</p><p>
			The only solution I found was:
			<center><table
							border=1 bgcolor=black>
						<tr><td bgcolor=lightblue colspan=3>
				<pre>                                                                                </pre>
			</td></tr>
			<tr><td>
				<table cellspacing=5 border=0
					 style="color:white;">
				<tr><td>
					<pre>
mkpipe pipe
tee out < pipe &
exec > pipe 2>&1
</pre>
							</td></tr>
							</table>
						</td></tr>
						</table></center>
			</p><p>
			That is a problem for parallel execution, though, so I am still looking for a
			better way to do it.
			</p><p>
			Once I have the output, it is relatively easy to analyze it, as I already
			made a script which disects the output into valgrind output and the test
			case it came from, then groups by common valgrind output and shows the
			result to the user.

			<h2>A day full of rebase... and a little valgrind</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			I think that I am progressing nicely with my rebase -p work, so much so
			that I will soon be able to use it myself to work on topic branches <u>and</u>
			rebase all the time without much hassle.
			</p><p>
			In other words, I would like to be able to rebase all my topic branches
			to Junio's <i>next</i> branch whenever that has new commits.  With a single
			rebase.
			</p><p>
			And finally, I got the idea of the thing Stephen implemented for dropped
			commits; however, I am quite sure I do not like it.
			</p><p>
			So what are "dropped" commits?
			</p><p>
			When you rebase, chances are that the upstream already has applied at
			least some of your patches.  So we filter those out with <i>--cherry-pick</i>.
			Stephen calls those "dropped" commits.
			</p><p>
			Then he goes on to reinvent the "$REWRITTEN" system: a directory containing
			the mappings of old commit names to new commit names.  That is easily fixed.
			</p><p>
			But worse, he substitutes the dropped commits with their <u>parents</u>, instead
			of substituting them with the corresponding commits in upstream.
			</p><p>
			I guess this will be a medium-sized fight on the mailing list, depending
			how much energy Stephen wants to put in to defend his strategy.
			</p><p>
			Anyway, I finally got to a point where only three of the tests are failing,
			t3404, t3410 and t3412.  Somewhat disappointing is t3404, as its name pretends
			not to exercize -p at all.  Oh well, I guess I'll see what is broken tomorrow.
			</p><p>
			Another part of the day was dedicated to the Valgrind patch series, which
			should give us yet another level of code quality.
			</p><p>
			After having confused myself with several diverging/obsolete branches, I did
			indeed finally manage to send that patch series off.  Woohoo.

			<h2>Regular diff with word coloring (as opposed to word diff)</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			You know, if I were a bit faster with everything I do, I could do so much more!
			</p><p>
			For example, Junio's idea that you could keep showing a regular diff, only
			coloring the words that have been removed/deleted.
			</p><p>
			Just imagine looking at the diff of a long line in LaTeX source code.  It
			should be much nicer to the eye to see the complete removed/added sentences
			instead of one sentence with colored words in between, disrupting your read
			flow.
			</p><p>
			Compare these two versions:
			</p><p>
			Regular diff with colored words:
			<blockquote><tt>
			-This sentence has a <font color=red>tyop</font> in it.<br>
			+This sentence has a <font color=green>typo</font> in it.<br>
			</tt></blockquote>
			</p><p>
			Word diff:
			<blockquote><tt>
			This sentence has a <font color=red>tyop</font><font color=green>typo</font> in it.<br>
			</tt></blockquote>
			</p><p>
			And it should not be hard to do at all!
			</p><p>
			In <i>diff_words_show()</i>, we basically get the minus lines as
			<i>diff_words->minus</i> and the plus lines as <i>diff_words->plus</i>.  The
			function then prepares the word lists and calls the xdiff engine to do all the
			hard work, analyzing the result from xdiff and printing the lines in
			<i>fn_out_diff_words_aux()</i>.
			</p><p>
			So all that would have to be changed would be to <u>record</u> the positions
			of the removed/added words instead of outputting them, and at the end printing
			the minus/plus buffers using the recorded information to color the words.
			</p><p>
			This would involve
			</p><p>
			<ul>
			<li>adding two new members holding the offsets in the <i>diff_words</i>
			struct,
			<li>having a special handling for that mode in
			<i>fn_out_diff_words_aux()</i> that appends the offsets and
			returns,
			<li>adding a function <i>show_lines_with_colored_words()</i> that
			outputs a buffer with a given prefix ('-' or '+') and coloring the words at
			given offsets with a given color,
			<li>modify <i>diff_words_show()</i> to call that function for the "special
			case: only removal" and at the end of the function, and
			<li> disabling the <i>fwrite()</i> at the end of <i>diff_words_show()</i> for that
			mode.
			</ul>
			</p><p>
			Of course, the hardest part is to find a nice user interface for that.  Maybe
			<i>--colored-words</i>? &#x263a;

			<h2>Ideas for a major revamp of the <i>--preserve-merges</i> handling in <i>git rebase</i></h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			As probably everybody agrees, the code to preserve merges is a big mess 
			right now.
			</p><p>
			Worse, the whole concept of "pick <merge-sha1>" just does not fly well.
			</p><p>
			So I started a <u>major</u> cleanup, which happens to reduce the code very 
			nicely so far.
			</p><p>
			It will take a few days to flesh out, I guess, but these are the major 
			ideas of my work:
			</p><p>
			<b>pick $sha1</b><br>
			<blockquote>will only work on non-merges in the future.</blockquote>
			<b>merge $sha1 [$sha1...] was $sha1 Merge ...</b><br>
			<blockquote>will merge the given list of commits into the current HEAD, for 
				the user's reference and to keep up-to-date what was rewritten, 
				the original merge is shown after the keyword "was" (which is not 
				a valid SHA-1, luckily).</blockquote>
			<b>goto $sha1</b><br>
			<blockquote>will reset the HEAD to the given commit.</blockquote>
			<b>$sha1'</b><br>
			<blockquote>for merge and goto, if a $sha1 ends in a single quote, the 
				rewritten commit is substituted (if there is one).</blockquote>
			</p><p>
			Example:
			</p><p>
<pre>
A - B - - - E 
  \       /
    C - D
</pre>
			</p><p>
			could yield this TODO script:
			</p><p>
<pre>
	pick A
	pick C
	pick D
	goto A'
	pick B
	merge D' was E
</pre>
			</p><p>
			This should lead to a much more intuitive user experience.
			</p><p>
			I am very sorry if somebody actually scripted <i>rebase -i -p</i> (by setting 
			GIT_EDITOR with a script), but I am very certain that this cleanup is 
			absolutely necessary to make <i>rebase -i -p</i> useful.
			</p>

			<h2>Thoughts about <i>interactive rebase</i></h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Somebody mentioned that my <i>my-next</i> branch is a mess, as it mixes all
			kinds of topics.
			</p><p>
			That is undeniably true, however, there is a good reason that I do not
			have a lot of topic branches: I work on more than just one computer.
			</p><p>
			To make sure that I do not lose a commit by mistake, I always <i>rebase -i</i>
			the <i>my-next</i> branch of the computer I happen to work on on top of the
			<i>my-next</i> branch I fetch from <a href=http://repo.or.cz>repo.or.cz</a>.
			</p><p>
			To rebase a lot of topic branches at the same time seems a bit complicated.
			But that is actually what the <i>-p</i> option (preserve merges) is all about.
			</p><p>
			The only problem is that the code for <i>rebase -i -p</i> has been messed up
			recently, quite successfully, I might add.
			</p><p>
			Worse, some people are pushing for a completely and total unintuitive syntax.
			</p><p>
			So maybe I will start to work on <i>-p</i> again, for my own use (I should learn
			to heed the principle more: work on things I can use myself).
			</p><p>
			My current idea is to implement a "goto" statement that will jump to another
			commit.  To make it easily usable, I will add the semantics that "goto" will
			always try to go to the <u>rewritten</u> version of the given commit; if the user
			wanted to have the original commit, she has to paste the unabbreviated commit
			name.
			</p><p>
			The more I think about it, the more I actually like this idea &#x263a;
			</p><p>
			Of course, working on this little project means that I will have to cope with
			that ugly code again.  *urgh*
