			<h1>Dscho's blog</h1>
			<h6>Thursday, 22nd of January, Anno Domini MMIX, at the hour of the Rabbit</h6>
			<h2>My blog has style</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			It is official.  The blog has a style sheet now.
			</p><p>
			The major problem was how to design the system such that it would work
			both locally and on <a href=http://repo.or.cz>repo.or.cz</a> via gitweb.
			</p><p>
			Basically, I realized that I'd need a dry run mode anyway, to prevent
			all my failed attemp.. oops, I meant, to prevent an accidental push
			when I am at an, ahem, intermediate state of the 'blog' branch.
			</p><p>
			Therefore, I could write a different file locally, which I can load
			into my venerable Firefox.
			</p><p>
			The next plans with my new toy are to enable an easy way to support
			showing images, and then maybe a table of contents.  External links
			would be cool (<a href=http://repo.or.cz>repo.or.cz</a> does not count, it is special-cased), too.
			</p><p>
			And later maybe a cut-off, with automatic generation of links to older
			posts.  Hmm, for those, I'll have to change the URL to include the
			current commit name, so that the images will be found, too...
			</p><p>
			Which in turn means that I'll have to parse the source for new
			images first, so that they can be in the commit that index.html
			will link to, <u>before</u> it gets committed.  Oh well, that cannot be
			helped! &#x263a;

			<h2>My new blog system... bloGit</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Nowadays, you got to have your blog.  Or better: your blogs.  Even Junio
			blogs about Git.
			</p><p>
			So I felt a little left behind, having no blog to show off.  But then
			I read about this fantastic new website on the mailing list, called
			<i>git planet</i> which was supposed to be a place where you could have your
			Git located blog.
			</p><p>
			Except that you could not have your blog <u>there</u>.  Instead, it is just an
			aggregator site.
			</p><p>
			I was disappointed.
			</p><p>
			But then, I had this (in my humble opinion very cute) idea that I already used to "publish"
			my slides from the talk "Contributing with Git (AKA All your rebase are
			belong to us)": back then, I just created a new branch, committed the
			file, and uploaded the result to <a href=http://repo.or.cz>repo.or.cz</a>, to be downloaded via Gitweb.
			</p><p>
			So I asked Pasky via IRC, if he would have any objections if I abused
			<a href=http://repo.or.cz>repo.or.cz</a> as a blog server.  He understood at once, and found it "sounds
			like a pretty cool idea".
			</p><p>
			Of course, just writing plain HTML and committing that is <i>too easy</i>,
			therefore I decided to write a shell script that would turn some sort
			of simple text file into proper HTML, commit it, and upload the result.
			</p><p>
			Well, about two hours later, I finished the first version of the script
			turning plain text with minimal markup into an HTML page, and it obviously
			worked -- otherwise nobody would be able to read this &#x263a;
