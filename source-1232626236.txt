The UGFWIINI contest

Just in case somebody finds this blog, here is a challenge.  Inspired by my
own little hack (this blog), I announce the "Using Git For What It Is Not
Intended" contest.

And it is especially cool, since the acronym sounds cool!  You might miss
this fact if you do no know that I pronounce the "F" like an "A" so that
it sounds cool.

This will be a running contest; whenever I have 10 valid applications, I
will announce a winner on the Git mailing list.

So, what accounts for a valid application?

<ul>
<li> You must use a Git program (the term is used loosely here, GitWeb is
     considered a Git program, for example).
<li> The program must be intended for something completely different than
     what you are using it for.  E.g. GitWeb -- which was intended to let
     you browse through the history using your web browser -- is used
     to serve a blog to the wide world.
<li> You must be able to prove that you actually used the Git program to
     the purpose you claim, preferably in a live demonstration like this
     one.
<li> Nobody and nothing must be harmed in the process (except your
     laughing muscle, that's okay).
</ul>

So, how does such an abuse look like?

<ul>
<li> ... like this blog.
<li> Managing your mail (in maildir format) in a Git repository.
<li> Finding duplicate files by
<bash>
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git ls-files --stage | sort -k2 | uniq -d -s7 -w40
</bash>
<li> Abusing the Git alias mechanism to call scripts defined directly in
     the config.
</ul>

I am really looking forward to all of your submissions... *chuckles*
