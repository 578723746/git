New valgrind series

I spent quite some time cleaning up that patch series, and feel pretty
exhausted.

Granted, the new ''git rebase -i -p'' does its job without complaint so far
(so much so that I think I'll release a version of my ''rebase'' series
soonish), but it _is_ a hassle when you have patches that you have a hard
time to decide upon the order/commit boundaries.

For example, I could imagine that the patch making the location of the
templates independent of the location of the Git binaries should come
_before_ my patch series, and the valgrind specific part should then
be squashed into the first valgrind commit.

Also, it uses two features of valgrind 3.4.0:

<ul>
<li>''...'' in the suppression file, and
<li>''--track-origins=yes''
</ul>

The latter is actually the reason I am pretty willing to keep the
requirement of that valgrind version, as it is really, really useful.

I guess we will see what happens to it.
