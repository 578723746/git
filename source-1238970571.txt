How to recover from a hackathon

Phew, 2 crazy and fantastic weeks are behind me.  But it takes its toll:
a weekend I was more offline than online.

Things that are important now: relax. sleep. take a walk. learn to sleep
more than 4 hours a night again. learn to watch a movie without thinking
about code. go for a run.

And after recovering, back to the rebase-i-p branch!
